# Arjun Satarkar's Userscripts

Userscripts are similar to browser extensions - JavaScript code executed on certain sites in order to enhance the experience in some way. You need a userscript manager browser extension, like https://www.greasespot.net/[Greasemonkey] or https://www.tampermonkey.net/[Tampermonkey], to use them.

These are userscripts I've created, primarily for my own use. They're generally small, simple tweaks to particular sites.
