# ExplainXKCD-Quick-Link

## Usage

Load `show_xkcd_date.user.js` into your userscript manager of choice (it is tested with Greasemonkey).

A userscript is a bit like a browser extension - it's a JavaScript file which is automatically executed on certain pages (in this case on xkcd) and improves them in some way. You will need an extension like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey to use userscripts.
