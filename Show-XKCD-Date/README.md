## Usage

Load `show_xkcd_date.user.js` into your userscript manager of choice (it is tested with Tampermonkey).

A userscript is a bit like a browser extension - it's a JavaScript file which is automatically executed on certain pages (in this case on xkcd) and improves them in some way. You will need an extension like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey to use userscripts.
