# ExplainXKCD-Quick-Link

A userscript for [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/), "a webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language", which for each comic adds a link to the comic's [explain xkcd](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) page.

Here is a screenshot of the addition:

This will always go to the page for the specific comic you are viewing.

## Usage

Load `explainxkcd_quick_link.user.js` into your userscript manager of choice (it is tested with Greasemonkey).

A userscript is a bit like a browser extension - it's a JavaScript file which is automatically executed on certain pages (in this case on xkcd) and improves them in some way. You will need an extension like Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey to use userscripts.
